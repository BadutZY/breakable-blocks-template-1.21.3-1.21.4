I modified a mod called Obtainable End by gniftygnome and I added my own mod to make the spawner obtainable as well.


# Breakable Block
Make end portals and spawner obtainable in survival.

See gniftygnome Obtainable End MOD [wiki](https://github.com/gniftygnome/obtainable-end/wiki) for configuration and details.
